                   <h3> <b>Early Life and background  :</b></h3>
                    Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[17] was born on 2 October 1869[1] into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Baniya family[18] in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), 
                    a <br>coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the Indian Empire. His 
                    father,<br> Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the diwan (chief minister) of Porbandar state. <br><br>

                    <h3><b>English barrister:</b></h3>
                    Gandhi came from a poor family, and he had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford.[48] Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family 
                    friend, <br>advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London.[49] In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first 
                    surviving son,Harilal.<br>[50] His mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas 
                    also tried to dissuade his<br> nephew. Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from 
                    meat, alcohol and women. <br>Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave    
                    Gandhi her permission and <br>blessing<br><br>

                    <h3><b>Civil rights activist in South Africa (1893–1914)</b></h3>
                    n April 1893, Gandhi aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's cousin.[55][56] He spent 21 years in South Africa, where he <br>
                    developed his political views, ethics and politics.[57] Immediately upon arriving in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination because of his skin colour<br>
                     and heritage, like all people of colour.[58] He was not allowed to sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver,<br>
                      then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg <br>
                      after refusing to leave the first-class.[59][60] He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his <br>
                      rights.[60] He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day.<br><br>

                    <h3><b>Europeans, Indians and Africans</b></h3>
                    Gandhi focused his attention on Indians while in South Africa. He was not interested in politics. This changed after he was discriminated against<br>
                     and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with<br>
                      Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, and he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming <br>
                      the Natal Indian Congress.[75] According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, and in some cases, distressing <br>
                      to those who admire him. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him<br>
                       his rights, and the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a "parasite", "semi-barbarous", "canker", "squalid coolie", "yellow man",<br>
                        and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.<br><br>

                   <h3> <b>Struggle for Indian independence (1915–1947)</b></h3>
                    At the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to him by C. F. Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international reputation <br>
                    as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser. Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues,<br>
                     politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, <br>
                     and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to <br>
                     make it look Indian<br><br>
