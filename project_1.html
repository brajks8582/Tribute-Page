                   <h3> <b>Early Life and background  :</b></h3>
                    Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[17] was born on 2 October 1869[1] into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Baniya family[18] in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), 
                    a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the Indian Empire. His 
                    father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the diwan (chief minister) of Porbandar state.

                    <h3><b>English barrister:</b></h3>
                    Gandhi came from a poor family, and he had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford.[48] Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family 
                    friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London.[49] In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first 
                    surviving son,Harilal.[50] His mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas 
                    also tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from 
                    meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave    
                    Gandhi her permission and blessing

                    <h3><b>Civil rights activist in South Africa (1893–1914)</b></h3>
                     April 1893, Gandhi aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's cousin.[55][56] He spent 21 years in South Africa, where he 
                    developed his political views, ethics and politics.[57] Immediately upon arriving in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination because of his skin colour
                     and heritage, like all people of colour.[58] He was not allowed to sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver,
                      then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg 
                      after refusing to leave the first-class.[59][60] He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his 
                      rights.[60] He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day.

                    <h3><b>Europeans, Indians and Africans</b></h3>
                    Gandhi focused his attention on Indians while in South Africa. He was not interested in politics. This changed after he was discriminated against
                     and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with
                      Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, and he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming                      the Natal Indian Congress.[75] According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, and in some cases, distressing <br>
                      to those who admire him. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him
                       his rights, and the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a "parasite", "semi-barbarous", "canker", "squalid coolie", "yellow man",
                        and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.

                   <h3> <b>Struggle for Indian independence (1915–1947)</b></h3>
                    At the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to him by C. F. Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international reputation 
                    as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser. Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues,
                     politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, 
                     and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to 
                     make it look Indian
